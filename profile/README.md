DATALAB â€“ Center for Digital Social Research is an interdisciplinary research center established in 2016 under the School of Communication and Culture, at Aarhus University in Denmark. The center focuses on citizens, collectives and populations in algorithmic and datafied societies, particularly in AI-powered algorithmic communication spaces, associated socio-technical actors, agentic patterns and effects, policy and regulatory frameworks (e.g. in AI chatbots and social media). DATALAB hosts fundamental and mission-driven research projects, theoretically based but empirical by nature and often including large-scale trace data. The projects utilize a plethora of different types of methods, often combining computational social science, experiments, surveys, digital ethnography, and interviews.   

DATALAB Researchers and projects share a vision and fundamental interest in creating novel methods and reinterpreting theories to better understand the social fabric in algorithmic and data-driven societies with a particular sensitivity towards principles of democracy, human rights, and ethics and changes therein.
